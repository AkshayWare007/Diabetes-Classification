Basic implementation of different classifiers for predicting whether a patient has diabetes or not. This is simple binary classification based on the `pima-indian-diabetes-dataset` found on Kaggle. 

### Classifiers used

Experimented with the following classifiers:

- SVM
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Ada Boost
- Ensemble Classifier

Also played around cleaning and standardizing the dataset.

### Prerequisites

- python-2.7.11
- scikit-learn
